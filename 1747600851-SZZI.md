# Eigenvectors & Eigenvalues
An eigenvalue is a scalar that indicates how much an eigenvector is stretched or shrunk during a linear transformation. The eigenvector is a non-zero vector that only changes by the scalar factor (the eigenvalue) when the transformation is applied. In the equation Ax = λx, A is a square matrix, x is the eigenvector, and λ is the eigenvalue.

# Finding Eigenvectors
To find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a square matrix $A$, follow these steps:

1. **Eigenvalues**: Solve the characteristic equation $\det(A - \lambda I) = 0$ for $\lambda$, where $I$ is the identity matrix of the same size as $A$. The solutions $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_n$ are the eigenvalues of $A$.

2. **Eigenvectors**: For each eigenvalue $\lambda$, find the eigenvectors by solving the equation $(A - \lambda I)\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0}$ for the vector $\mathbf{v}$. The non-zero solutions to this equation are the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue $\lambda$.

We can use these eigenvectors to define the basis of the [[1747601149-UXBW|Eigenspace]]
