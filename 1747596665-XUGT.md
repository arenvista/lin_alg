# Null Space
Is a type of [[1747596143-VBQF|vector space]]
It describes the space of vectors, $x$, such that $Ax=0$ holds true

## Finding the [[1747601286-KHGK|Basis]] of Null Space
1. Solve for REF of A 
2. Solve for parametric vector form of REF
3. Set dependent vars in terms of free vars
4. Construct vectors in terms of coefficents of free vars
5. Aggergate vectors into a set
