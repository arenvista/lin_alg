# Coordinates via Basis
To construct coordinates via a set of basis vectors in a vector space, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Basis**: A basis $\{ \mathbf{b}_1, \mathbf{b}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{b}_n \}$ for a vector space $V$ is a set of linearly independent vectors that span $V$. This means any vector $\mathbf{v}$ in $V$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors.

2. **Express the Vector**: Given a vector $\mathbf{v} \in V$, express it as a linear combination of the basis vectors:
   $$ \mathbf{v} = c_1 \mathbf{b}_1 + c_2 \mathbf{b}_2 + \cdots + c_n \mathbf{b}_n $$

3. **Determine the Coordinates**: The scalars $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$ are the coordinates of the vector $\mathbf{v}$ with respect to the basis $\{ \mathbf{b}_1, \mathbf{b}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{b}_n \}$.

4. **Form the Coordinate Vector**: The coordinates can be organized into a coordinate vector:
   $$ [\mathbf{v}]_B = \begin{bmatrix} c_1 \\ c_2 \\ \vdots \\ c_n \end{bmatrix} $$

This coordinate vector $[\mathbf{v}]_B$ represents the vector $\mathbf{v}$ in the basis $B$. The process of finding these coordinates involves solving a system of linear equations if the coefficients $c_i$ are not immediately apparent.

**Example**: Suppose $V = \mathbb{R}^2$ and the basis is $\{ \mathbf{b}_1 = (1, 0), \mathbf{b}_2 = (0, 1) \}$. For a vector $\mathbf{v} = (3, 4)$, the coordinates are simply $c_1 = 3$ and $c_2 = 4$, hence the coordinate vector is $[\mathbf{v}]_B = \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}$.

This method can be generalized to any finite-dimensional vector space and any set of basis vectors for that space.
