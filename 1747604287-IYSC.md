# Span

The span of a set of vectors in linear algebra is the collection of all possible linear combinations of those vectors. More formally, if $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ are vectors in a vector space $V$, then the span of $\{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n\}$ is the set:

$$
\text{Span}\{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n\} = \{c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 + \cdots + c_nv_n \mid c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n \in \mathbb{R}\}
$$

where $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$ are scalars in the field over which the vector space is defined, typically the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$. The span essentially describes all the vectors that can be reached by scaling and adding the given set of vectors. If the span of a set of vectors is the entire vector space $V$, then the set is said to be a spanning set for $V$.
