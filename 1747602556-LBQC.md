# Orthogonality
Orthogonality of vectors can be defined in terms of the dot product. Two vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ are orthogonal if their dot product is zero:

$$ \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0 $$

This means that the angle between the two vectors is 90 degrees (or $\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians), indicating that they are perpendicular to each other in the vector space.
