# Vector Space & Subspaces

We can use sets of objects not traditionally thought of as vectors and treat them as such --allowing us to use linear algebraic priniples to quickly solve large systems

*"If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and acts like a duck --why not treat it like a duck"*

A set can be considered a vector space if and only if the following are met:

<center> Consider a set H </center>

## The set is closed under vector addition 
$$x,y \in H \rightarrow x+y \in H$$

## The set is closed under scalar multiplication
$$c \in R, x \in H \rightarrow cx \in H$$

## The set contains the zero vector
$$\vec 0 \in H$$
