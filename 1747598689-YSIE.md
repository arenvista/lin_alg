# Determinants

Determinants provide the area of the parallelogram (in two dimensions) or the volume of the parallelepiped (in three dimensions) spanned by the associated vectors. It is a measure of how space changes across a transformation, and is mathematically defined as $|A|$ for a matrix $A$, indicating how much the transformation associated with $A$ scales areas or volumes.

In order to find a determinants the most straight forward way is to use [[1747598768-NUAP|Laplace Cofactor Expansion]]

This is particlurly useful for finding the [[1747595585-NGGN|inverse]] of a $A_{2x2}$ matrix

To find the inverse of a 2x2 matrix $A = \begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix}$, one can use the formula:

$$ A^{-1} = \frac{1}{ad - bc} \begin{bmatrix} d & -b \\ -c & a \end{bmatrix} $$

Recongnize then:
**The determinant $ad - bc$ must be non-zero for the inverse to exist. This formula makes it straightforward to compute the inverse of a 2x2 matrix without performing row operations.**
