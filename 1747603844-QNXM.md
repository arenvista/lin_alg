# Orthogonal Projections

We can find an [[1747602556-LBQC|orthogonal]] projection of a vector as follows 

An orthogonal projection of a vector $\mathbf{v}$ onto a subspace spanned by a vector $\mathbf{u}$ can be computed using the formula:

$$
\mathrm{proj}_{\mathbf{u}} \mathbf{v} = \frac{\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u}}{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u}} \mathbf{u}
$$

This is true because the orthogonal projection is defined as the vector in the subspace that is closest to $\mathbf{v}$. The term $\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u}$ represents the dot product, which measures the extent to which $\mathbf{v}$ aligns with $\mathbf{u}$. Dividing by $\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u}$, the dot product of $\mathbf{u}$ with itself, scales $\mathbf{u}$ to have unit magnitude in the direction of the subspace, yielding a scalar multiple of $\mathbf{u}$ that represents the projection of $\mathbf{v}$ along $\mathbf{u}$.
