# Basis

In linear algebra, a basis of a vector space is a set of vectors that are linearly independent and span the entire space. This means every vector in the space can be expressed as a unique linear combination of the basis vectors. A basis provides a way to describe the space in terms of its dimensionality and allows for the representation of any vector in that space.

In the context of a basis in linear algebra, the maximal set and minimal set theorems are important concepts related to vector spaces:

1. **Maximal Set Theorem**: This theorem states that a linearly independent set of vectors in a vector space can be extended to form a basis of that space. In other words, if you have a linearly independent set, you can add more vectors to it (if necessary) until it becomes a basis, which is a maximal linearly independent set.

To present the Maximal Set Theorem using symbols, consider a vector space $V$ and a linearly independent set of vectors $S = \{ \mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_k \} \subset V$. The theorem asserts that there exists a basis $B = \{ \mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_k, \mathbf{w}_1, \mathbf{w}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{w}_m \}$ for $V$, where each $\mathbf{w}_i \in V$ such that $B$ is a maximal linearly independent set. In formal terms, this means:

1. $S \subseteq B$.
2. $B$ spans $V$: $\text{span}(B) = V$.
3. $B$ is linearly independent.
4. If any vector is added to $B$, it will become linearly dependent.

Therefore, $|B| = \dim(V)$. This illustrates the principle that any linearly independent set can be extended to a basis of the vector space by including additional vectors as necessary.

2. **Minimal Set Theorem**: This theorem indicates that any spanning set of vectors for a vector space can be reduced to form a basis of that space. This means if you have a set of vectors that span the space, you can remove some vectors (if possible) until you have a linearly independent set that still spans the space, which is a minimal spanning set.

Let $V$ be a vector space and let $S = \{ \mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_n \}$ be a spanning set for $V$. According to the Minimal Set Theorem, there exists a subset $B \subseteq S$ such that $B$ is a basis for $V$. In symbols, $B = \{ \mathbf{u}_1, \mathbf{u}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{u}_m \}$ with $m \leq n$ and $B$ satisfying these conditions:

1. **Spanning Condition**: $\text{span}(B) = V$.
2. **Linear Independence**: The vectors $\mathbf{u}_1, \mathbf{u}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{u}_m$ are linearly independent.

Thus, the minimal spanning set $B$ is a basis where $S$ can be reduced by removing redundant vectors that do not contribute to the span of $V$ without losing linear independence.
