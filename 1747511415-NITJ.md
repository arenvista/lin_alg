# Linear Independence

Given a set of vectors we can say such vectors are linearly independent if and only if 

$$c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 + ... + c_nv_n = 0$$

For a vector to be linearly independent implies that there does not exist a linear combination of the other vectors in the set such that the input vector is produced

and all coefficients $c_1, c_2, ..., c_n$ are zero.

A set of vectors is said to be linearly dependent if at least one of the vectors in the set can be written as a linear combination of the others. In this case, there exist coefficients, not all zero, such that:

$$d_1v_1 + d_2v_2 + ... + d_nv_n = 0$$

where at least one coefficient $d_i \neq 0$. This means one or more vectors in the set can be expressed in terms of others in the same set, establishing a dependency relationship among them.

In the context of vector spaces, linear independence and dependence describe relationships between vectors. A set of vectors is linearly independent if none of the vectors can be generated by a linear combination of the others. This means that the only solution to the equation

$$c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 + ... + c_nv_n = 0$$

is when all coefficients $c_1, c_2, ..., c_n$ are zero.

If any vector in the set can be expressed as a combination of others, the set is linearly dependent. For instance, if

$$d_1v_1 + d_2v_2 + ... + d_nv_n = 0$$

with at least one $d_i \neq 0$, then at least one vector is redundant as it relies on the others.

This concept relates to the idea of [[1747604287-IYSC|Span]] because a set of linearly independent vectors spans a vector space in an optimal manner, without redundancy. Conversely, a linearly dependent set has some vectors that can be removed without affecting the span, because they do not contribute new directions beyond those already covered by the independent vectors.
