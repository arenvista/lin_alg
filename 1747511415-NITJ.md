# Linear Independence

Given a set of vectors we can say such vectors are linearly independent if and only if 

$$c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 + ... + c_nv_n = 0$$

For a vector to be linearly independent implies that there does not exist a linear combination of the other vectors in the set such that the input vector is produced
