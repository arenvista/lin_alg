# Orthogonal Compliments

An orthogonal complement is a concept in linear algebra. For a given subspace $W$ of an inner product space $V$, the orthogonal complement $W^\perp$ is the set of vectors in $V$ that are orthogonal to every vector in $W$. In other words, a vector $v \in W^\perp$ if and only if $v \cdot w = 0$ for all $w \in W$, where $v \cdot w$ represents the inner product of $v$ and $w$.

The orthogonal complement has several important properties:

1. $(W^\perp)^\perp = W$: The orthogonal complement of the orthogonal complement of $W$ is $W$ itself.
2. $W \cap W^\perp = \{0\}$: The only vector that is both in $W$ and $W^\perp$ is the zero vector.
3. $\dim(W) + \dim(W^\perp) = \dim(V)$: The dimensions of a subspace and its orthogonal complement add up to the dimension of the entire space $V$.

In finite-dimensional spaces, if $V$ is equipped with an orthonormal basis, these properties can be conveniently used to find the orthogonal complement of subspaces. Orthogonal complements play a crucial role in various applications such as solving systems of linear equations, analyzing projections, and Fourier analysis.

# Row(A) & Col(A) Compliment
On this note here are some important relationships:

$$Row(A) \perp Null(A)$$
$$Row(A) = Null(A)^\perp$$
$$Col(A) = Null(A)^T$$
$$Col(A) = Null(A)^{T^\perp}$$
To understand these relationships, we need to consider the fundamental theorem of linear algebra, which relates the four fundamental subspaces associated with a matrix $A$: the row space $Row(A)$, the column space $Col(A)$, the null space $Null(A)$, and the left null space $Null(A^T)$.

1. $Row(A) \perp Null(A)$: This relationship states that the row space of a matrix $A$ is orthogonal to its null space. This is because if $x \in Null(A)$, then $Ax = 0$, and any vector in $Row(A)$ can be written as $A^T y$. Therefore, $y^T A x = 0$, indicating orthogonality.

2. $Row(A) = Null(A)^\perp$: This is a different way of stating the above orthogonality. The orthogonal complement of the null space $Null(A)$ is the row space $Row(A)$.

3. $Col(A) = Null(A^T)^\perp$: The column space of $A$ is the orthogonal complement of the null space of $A^T$. This follows from the fact that the left null space $Null(A^T)$ consists of all vectors $y$ such that $A^T y = 0$, meaning they're orthogonal to the column space of $A$.

4. $Col(A) = Null(A^T)^\perp$: This is a repetition of the third statement, emphasizing that the column space is indeed the orthogonal complement of the left null space.
