# Linear Transformation

A transformation $T: R^n \rightarrow R^m$ is linear if...
$$ T(u+v) = T(u) + T(v) \forall u,v \in R^n$$
$$ T(cu) = cT(u) \forall c \in R, \forall u \in R^n$$


In linear algebra, a linear transformation is a mapping between two vector spaces that preserves the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication. Formally, a transformation $T: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$ is linear if, for all vectors $\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and scalar $c \in \mathbb{R}$, the following properties hold:

1. $T(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) = T(\mathbf{u}) + T(\mathbf{v})$
2. $T(c \mathbf{u}) = c T(\mathbf{u})$

To represent a linear transformation as a matrix, we can express it in terms of its action on the standard basis vectors. For example, if $T$ is a transformation in $\mathbb{R}^2$, it can be represented by a matrix $A$ such that:

$$
T(\mathbf{x}) = A \mathbf{x}
$$

where $\mathbf{x}$ is a vector in $\mathbb{R}^2$.

For a rotation transformation by an angle $\theta$, the matrix $A$ can be defined as:

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix}
\cos(\theta) & -\sin(\theta) \\
\sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta)
\end{pmatrix}
$$

This matrix, when multiplied by a vector $\mathbf{x} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}$, will rotate the vector counterclockwise by the angle $\theta$ in the plane.
