# Eigenspace
Is another [[1747596143-VBQF|vector space]] and can be found by solving for the [[1747596665-XUGT|Null Space]] of the mniltrix found from $A - \lambda I=0$

The eigenspace of a linear transformation or matrix is the set of all eigenvectors that correspond to a particular eigenvalue, along with the zero vector. In other words, it is the subspace formed by all vectors that, when the transformation is applied, yield a scalar multiple of themselves associated with that eigenvalue. The dimension of the eigenspace is called the geometric multiplicity of the eigenvalue.
