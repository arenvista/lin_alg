# Laplace Cofactor Expansion

$$\begin{bmatrix}
+,-,+,-,...\\
-,+,-,+,...\\
\end{bmatrix}$$

$$Laplace Cofactor = (-1)^{row + col}*A_{[row][col]}$$

1. Pick an element
2. Find cofactor
3. Construct submatrix (remove row,col associated with cofactor) 
4. Find subdeterminant
5. Add all determinants to find larger det.

This is also the reason why the determinant of a [[1747599095-YPQP|Trianglur Matrix]]
