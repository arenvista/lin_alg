# Laplace Cofactor Expansion

To find the [[1747598689-YSIE|determinants]] we can use the following method:

$$\begin{bmatrix}
+,-,+,-,...\\
-,+,-,+,...\\
\end{bmatrix}$$

$$Laplace Cofactor = (-1)^{row + col}*A_{[row][col]}$$

1. Pick an element
2. Find cofactor
3. Construct submatrix (remove row,col associated with cofactor) 
4. Find subdeterminant
5. Add all determinants to find larger det.

This is also the reason why the determinant of a [[1747599095-YPQP|Trianglur Matrix]]

A triangular matrix is either an upper triangular matrix or a lower triangular matrix. For an upper triangular matrix, all the elements below the main diagonal are zero. Conversely, for a lower triangular matrix, all the elements above the main diagonal are zero.

The determinant of a triangular matrix is simply the product of the diagonal elements. This results because the expansion of the determinant along any row or column in a triangular matrix involves cofactor multiplications with zeros, except for the diagonal elements.

For example, consider the determinant of the following upper triangular matrix:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
a & b & c \\
0 & d & e \\
0 & 0 & f \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The determinant is given by:

$$
\det = a \cdot d \cdot f
$$

In general, for an $n \times n$ triangular matrix $A$ with diagonal elements $a_{11}, a_{22}, \ldots, a_{nn}$, the determinant is:

$$
\det(A) = a_{11} \cdot a_{22} \cdot \ldots \cdot a_{nn}
$$

This simplification arises because the cofactor expansion across a row or column with zeros leads to the cancellation of terms not involving the diagonal elements.
